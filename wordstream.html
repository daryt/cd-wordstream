      <h2>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Marketing</h2>
      <p>PPC (<a href="#">pay-per click</a>) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PPC Automation - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <a href="#">pay-per click advertising,</a> automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity.  Often, this means being able to product an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.</li>
        <li>PPC Management - <a href="#">PPC management</a> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of <a href="#">paid search</a> marketing tasks.  Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an <a href="#">online ad campaign</a>.</li>

      <p>WordStream's <a href="#">PPC software</a> is specifically designed to aid in these two <a href="#">PPC search engine</a> marketing areas.  This page will show you both the processes the software is automating for you, and the best course of action to take where workflow is concerned.</p>
